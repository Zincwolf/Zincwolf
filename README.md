- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zincwolf
- 👀 I used to be interested in Chemistry but now ... Well, just get the works at hand done. And then daydream about joining the AI trend.
- 🌱 I’m currently working hard in C++ and basic algorithms, and plan to learn Python and Javascript for more practical usages.
  ~~Maybe Financial is another way out~~
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ~~Mathmatical Analysis~~  and Data Structures and Algorithms...
- 📫 You can reach me at Wuzn001@sjtu.edu.cn!
